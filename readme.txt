These are just a few projects that I have worked on for school.

serial.c
A serial downloader written in C to utilize forks and "wget" and download a list of files from url.txt.

parallel.c
A parallel downloader written in C to utilize forks and "wget" and download a list of files from url.txt.
This is a modified version of serial.c to show the understanding of how forks work and how to make the files download at the same time.

parser.cpp
This was a summer project in which we had about 3 weeks to complete a full parser written by hand without the usage of parser building software.
The code is a bit sloppy and we ended up getting an A.  There are a few problems with the faux assembly code line outputs but it reads and parses a text file based
upon the syntax rules we were given.  Given that we had only 3 weeks we were told to use recursive descent parsing rather than a parse table due to the limited amount
of time that we had.
